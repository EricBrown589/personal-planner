This is a Flask-based backend application for a personal planner. It provides a RESTful API for managing tasks, events, and journal entries, with support for recurring tasks and other features to help you organize your life.

---

## Features

-   **Task Management**: Create, retrieve, update, and delete tasks.
-   **Recurring Tasks**: Set up tasks that repeat daily or weekly.
-   **Event Scheduling**: Manage your calendar with endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting events.
-   **Journaling**: Keep a log of your thoughts, meals, or moods with a flexible journaling system.
-   **Database Integration**: Uses SQLAlchemy and Flask-Migrate to manage a postgresSQL database.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.10 or later
-   pip

### Dependencies

-   Flask~=3.1.2
-   flask-cors~=6.0.1
-   Flask-Migrate~=4.1.0
-   alembic~=1.16.5
-   SQLAlchemy~=2.0.43

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ericbrown589/personal-planner.git](https://github.com/ericbrown589/personal-planner.git)
    cd personal-planner
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
    .venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
    ```
3. **Configure the Database:**
  * Create a new PostgreSQL database (e.g., personal_planner).
  * Create a config.py file in the root of the project. This file is ignored by Git, so your credentials will be safe.
  * Add the following to your config.py, replacing the user, password, and database name with your own credentials:
    ```python
    from urllib.parse import quote_plus

    class Config:
      # Replace with your actual PostgreSQL credentials
      raw_password = 'your_super_secret_password'
      encoded_password = quote_plus(raw_password)
      SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = f'postgresql://user:{encoded_password}@localhost:5432/personal_planner'
      SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False
    ```
4.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5.  **Initialize the database:**
    ```bash
    flask db init
    flask db migrate -m "Initial migration."
    flask db upgrade
    ```
6.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```
